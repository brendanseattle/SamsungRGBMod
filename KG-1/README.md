## Components Needed

I will be detailing the mod using a SCART connector. You can instead choose a BNC/RCA jacks and an external 5V switch. I will point out where changes need to be made if you choose that route.

For this mod you will need:
* Properly shielded wires (I chose 20AWG silicone wire, you can use smaller gauge however)


## Modification Steps


### Note
We came up with the todo Ohm value through the following calculation:



If you choose to use diodes, you can instead use a todo Ohm resistor.
